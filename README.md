# Linecraft-CNC-Automation-Engine
This system was developed as the proprietary production engine for Linecraft Studios. The goal was to eliminate manual CNC plotting by building a robust software-to-hardware bridge capable of handling variable data (CSV/JSON), AI-generated text payloads, and precise machine queue management in a continuous production environment.
